## Overview
1) What is the problem we are trying to solve?
People’s attention span has been decreasing over the years and social media has contributed to this effect. Reading can stimulate the imagination, help people to refocus and open the mind to different ideas and cultures. Reading could help people to learn and entertain themselves more meaningfully. The We Read website aims to help people find and discover books more easily.

2) Why are we doing this?
The purpose of the We Read website will allow to search for books by title, author, genre and keywords. It will also give inspiration through the New York Times best reads and reviews. Additionally, it will facilitate the purchase of books through links to Amazon. Finally, the user can create an account to build a personalized Wishlist of books. The website will serve as a platform to get people to read more or to start to read, a book at a time. 

## Audience
The target audience is teenagers, young adults and adults regardless of gender. They may be avid readers or in search of a book that will start their reading journey. The teenagers and young adults’ audience would highly access the site with a phone and more mature audience with a desktop or a laptop.
